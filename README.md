# tada

Yet another header-only, **t**emplated **a**utomatic **d**ifferentiation library based on overloaded **a**rithmetic operators.

While there is already a [myriad of AD tools available](https://autodiff.org/?module=Tools), the main goal of this tool is to be compatible with [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic) data types **and** support GPU use cases.
